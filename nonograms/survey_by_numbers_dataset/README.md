## Overview

This folder contains a collection of Nonogram puzzles pulled from [a public dataset](https://webpbn.com/survey/) that's commonly used for testing solvers. The dataset is referenced in [this paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-86585-5_11) as a benchmark source.

## Why use these?

- Every puzzle gathered here as of now has **a unique solution**
- Offers some “real-life” puzzles with varying complexities
- On the website there's already data on how different solvers performed, which can help during the evaluation phase

## Where to get more

Single examples can be downloaded from [this page](https://webpbn.com/export.cgi)  
The parser works with the ```Format used in version 2 of Kyle Keen's Python solver``` option

**Alternatively**, a collection of parser-compatible files can be found [here](https://webpbn.com/survey/puzzles/)
